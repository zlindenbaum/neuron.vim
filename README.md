# neuron.vim
Manage your [Zettelkasten](https://neuron.zettel.page/2011401.html) with the
help of [neuron](https://github.com/srid/neuron) in {n}vim.

(This is an actively maintaned fork of [`ihsanturk/neuron.vim`](https://github.com/ihsanturk/neuron.vim) that works with newer versions of `neuron` and changes basically everything, with extra features, commands and different options.)

## Requirements

- [neuron](https://github.com/srid/neuron)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)
- [ag](https://github.com/mizuno-as/silversearcher-ag) if you intend to use the content search command.

## Installation
### Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
```vim
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
Plug 'fiatjaf/neuron.vim'
```

## Usage

  1. Open a zettel with `vim` or `nvim`. On `nvim` it should
     - Show a virtual floating text on the first line saying how many backlinks it has.
     - Show a virtual title for each linked zettel in the body.    

Most operations are executed in command mode      

  2. `gzZ` show a list of backlinks. Selecting one will navigate to it.
  3. `gzz` show a list of all zettels, you can search their titles. Selecting one will navigate to it.
  4. `gzi` show the same `gzz` list. Selecting one will insert a link to it right in front of the your cursor. `gzI` instead will insert a folgezettel link (`[[[...]]]`).
  5. If you put your cursor on top of a link to another zettel and press `gzo` you'll navigate to that.
  6. `gzl` will insert a link to the previous zettel you visited. 
     - `gzL` will do the same but with a folgezettel.
  7. `gzu` go back after editing another zettel type .
  8. `gzu` repeatedly multiple times will cycle between the two last visited zettels.
  9. `gzU` go back multiple times in the history of visited zettels (and `gzP` will go forward).
 10. `gzn` create a new blank zettel
 11. `gzN` you will create a new zettel using the current word under the cursor as its title. If you're in visual selection mode `gzN` will instead use the selected text (only the first line if there are more than one selected). `gzN` will always replace the selected text or current word with a link to the newly-created zettel.
 12. `gzs` works like `gzz`, but instead it searches the content of the zettels, not only the title. For this it calls the external command `ag`.

## Customization

  - `neuron.vim` uses a custom function to generate ids for new zettels that it creates, bypassing `neuron new` completely. By default it generates a random hex string of 8 characters. You can hook into the process by defining a function `g:CustomNeuronIDGenerator` in your `.vimrc` that takes an optional `title` argument. For example:

    To make it use the title as kebab-cased ID (when using `gzN`):

    ```
    func! g:CustomNeuronIDGenerator(title)
    	return substitute(a:title, " ", "-", "g")
    endf
    ```

    If `g:CustomNeuronIDGenerator` is not defined in your `.vimrc` or returns an empty string, `neuron.vim` will fall back to generating random IDs.
